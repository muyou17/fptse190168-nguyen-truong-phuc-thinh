###  [Blog 1 - Rapid ML experimentation for enterprises with Amazon SageMaker AI and Comet](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explores how enterprises can leverage Amazon SageMaker AI and Comet to streamline machine learning (ML) experimentation for scalable and reproducible workflows. It highlights the importance of robust experiment tracking, model lineage, and compliance in handling complex ML initiatives, particularly in regulated environments. The article demonstrates a fraud detection use case, guiding readers through setting up a managed ML environment, integrating Comet for experiment management, and processing imbalanced datasets. It also covers ensuring regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI regulations) and provides steps for administrators and users to configure and utilize SageMaker AI with Comet effectively.

###  [Blog 2 - ...](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices…), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. The article also guides you through the steps to set up the environment, organize the data processing pipeline, and ensure compliance with security & privacy standards such as HIPAA.
